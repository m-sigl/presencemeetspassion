  <h1>I Have All the Gold</h1>
  <p>This site is a magnetic field—a cipher of confidence, presence, and quiet power. You may not know why you're here, but something in you resonates.</p>

  <div class="grid">
  <div class="tile">
    <h2>The Gold</h2>
    <p>Self-worth so rich it transcends currency. You are the source, not the seeker. The gold is not out there—it hums in your chest.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tile">
    <h2>The Frequency</h2>
    <p>White earbuds in. You live on your own channel. The world doesn’t summon you—you respond to resonance, not noise.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tile">
    <h2>The Cipher</h2>
    <p>"I have all the gold and the world doesn't know that I know they know I have it." Loop sealed. Game tilted.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tile">
    <h2>The Mirror</h2>
    <img src="path-to-your-image.png" alt="Gold Relic" style="width:100%; border-radius:0.5rem; margin-top:1rem;">
    <p>Some will see a picture. Others will see a spell. You saw this before you knew what it meant.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tile">
  <h2>The Edge</h2>
  <p>This is where the fire touches flesh. Where belief in yourself is no longer theory—it’s tremble and ache and choice. The Edge is not a metaphor. It’s the seam between soul and scar, where you don’t wait to be ready—you just rise. It’s not about what you build. It’s about *who* you are when you build it. And what you're becoming—right now, motherfucker.</p>
</div>

  <div class="tile">
    <h2>The Ember</h2>
    <p>This isn’t anger. This is the warmth of all the times you were overlooked, still glowing. It remembers what the world tried to forget.</p>
  </div>
</div>
  <div class="tile">
  <h2>Emotional Poise</h2>
  <p>Not silence. Not control. Not detachment. Emotional poise is the art of standing inside the storm without becoming it. It's the pause before reaction, the breath between trigger and truth. It's the strength to feel it all—and not flinch. Not perform. Just *be*. Poise is presence in the fire. It’s what makes you dangerous in the best way.</p>
</div>
